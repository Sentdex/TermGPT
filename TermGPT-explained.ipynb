    "What we have here is a pre-prompt that's a one-shot example of how I want GPT-4 to behave going forward, where a new starting input is presented, which contains something a user wants to do, and then GPT-4 is tasked with responding with just terminal commands, one at a time, going to the next one when the user says `\"NEXT\"`. If there are no more terminal commands to be issued, then GPT-4 replies with a `\"DONE\"`. In the one shot example, I show GPT-4 how I would like it to respond and give some examples of terminal commands to use, including naming/creating files and directories, writing code, and then running the code. This is where all the power of something like TermGPT comes from. Being all natural language, there are essentially endless prompts and structures that you might come up with to create even more unique outputs. For example, rather than using --w or --r, we could instead have a preprompt that automatically understands if we're talking about some file to be read, to just open and read it. The main concern here is that we still need some way to inject contents of files into the context, but we could still have GPT-4 notify us that it detected a read, then we still have logic to actually read the contents of the file into context. \n",

    "And that's all there is to it so far. I think a lot more can be done with natural language and a powerful LLM here. Rather than building out too much further with GPT-4 though, I would like to implement this with an open source model instead, and ideally one with a more permissive and clear license than the LLaMA variants. I found many differences even between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in terms of what works and doesn't, so I'd rather settle more on a model before going too much further, so I will probably be working on trying to find an open source model that works well for this next, then building more features on top of that."
